Basic Battleship Game

left board (enemy AI) and right board is your board in which you can place your ships

Press left mouse klick to put the ships vertically
Press right mouse klick to put the ships horizontally

everyone has 5 ships (ship with 5 cells, ship with 4 cells and so on)
NOTE: you cannot place a ship next to another ship. There must be a gap between them!

after placing the ships and you can start to shoot the enemy board
as long as you do not miss, you can continue to shoot at the enemy
The same rule goes for the enemy AI which will try to shoot all cells of your ships

You win the game by hitting all the ships of the enemy (you have to hit every box of the ship)
